# PartyInvites
## Setting the Scene
Imagine that a friend has decided to host a New Yearâ€™s Eve party and that she has asked me to create a web app 
that allows her invitees to electronically RSVP. She has asked for these four key features:        
### A home page that shows information about the party
### A form that can be used to RSVP
### Validation for the RSVP form, which will display a thank-you page
### A summary page that shows who is coming to the party
